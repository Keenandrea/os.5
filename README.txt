INTRODUCTION
------------

The goal of this module, Proess Scheduling, is to 
simulate the process scheduling part of an Operat
ing System. Time-based scheduling will be impleme
nted, ignoring almost every other aspect of the O
S. Message queues will be used to synchronize.

REQUIREMENTS
------------

This module requires the following:

 * Hoare Linux (http://www.umsl.edu/technology/tsc/)
 * UMSL ID (https://www.umsl.edu/degrees/index.html)


INSTALLATION
------------

 * Install as you would normally install a distrib
   uted C module. To compile and execute, you must
   have the build-essential packages properly inst
   alled on your system. 


COMPILATION
-----------

To compile, open a new CLI window, change the the
directory nesting your module. Type:

 * make


EXECUTION
---------
Find the executable named master located in the d
irectory in which you compiled the module. Once y
ou have found it, run the following command:

	./oss

That will get the ball rolling. Check the ouput f
ile for details on execution. The output file is:
	
	log.txt

To see the contents of the most recent run, in yo
ur terminal, type:

	cat log.txt

In addition, there is a help option that you can
specify by running the command:

	./oss -h 

And another option to specify the number of proc
esses the machine is allowed:
	
	./master -n <number>

Keep the number between 1 and 18, to keep the ma
chine from being overwhelmed. If these rules are
broken, the number defaults to 18.
